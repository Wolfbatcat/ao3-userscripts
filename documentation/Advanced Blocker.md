## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Guide

**Wildcard Syntax**
- Use `*` to match any sequence of characters (zero or more) in tag, title, and summary blacklists.
- The `*` acts as a placeholder‚Äîit can match letters, spaces, punctuation, or nothing at all.
- Examples:
  - `Abandoned*` matches: Abandoned, Abandoned Work, Abandoned WIP
  - `*Fix*` matches: Fix-It, I Can Fix Him, Fixing Things, Big Fix
  - `Self*Insert*` matches: Self-Insert, Self-Insert Player, Self...Insert (with anything between)
  - `*Angst` matches: Angst, Major Angst, Existential Angst

**Comma-Separated Lists**
- Enter multiple items separated by commas: `Tag1, Tag2, Tag3`

**Tag vs. Title/Summary Matching**
- **Tags** use exact matching but are case-insensitive: `romance` will match 'Romance' but not `Slow Burn Romance`.
- **Titles & Summaries** use partial matching (use wildcards for fuzzy matching).
- **Authors** require exact name matches.

**Primary Relationships & Characters**
- Enter names exactly as they appear on AO3, including alternative names: `Luo Binghe/Shen Yuan | Shen Qingqiu`
- **Tag Window** settings let you check only the first X tags (default: 1 for relationships, 5 for characters).

**Language Filter**
- Enter language names as they appear on AO3: `English`, `–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π`, `‰∏≠Êñá-ÊôÆÈÄöËØùÂõΩËØ≠`
